#* Checking for Inequality
#  When you want to determine whether two values are not equal, you can
#  combine an exclamation point and an equal sign (!=). The exclamation
#  point represents not. Let's use another if statement to examine how
#  to use the inequality operator. 
requested_topping = 'mushrooms'
if requested_topping != 'anchovies':
    print("Hold the anchovies!")
#  The if statement compares the value of requested_topping to the value
#  'anchovies'. If these two values do not match, Python returns True
#  and executes the code following the if statement. 

#* Numerical Comparison
# The following code checks whether a person is 18 yeats old
age = 18
print(age == 18)
